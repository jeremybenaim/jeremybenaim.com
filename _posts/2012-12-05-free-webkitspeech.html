<p>Lately I found myself playing around with the webkitspeech attribute which essentially allows you to speak to your input element, but which works only on Chrome (for now...)</p>

<p>Thus, I tried to find more info on Google and what I've found has been pretty much the same thing each time :</p>

<blockquote>"How to enable speech input in Chrome?<br>
Add a webkitspeech attribute to your input tag, speak, and voila!"</blockquote>

<p>Some other would add a small trick to basically append the result to a textarea (just like Google Translate)</p>

<p>Well, this is cool, but no one did mention the other features that it offers.</p>

<h4>Pardon my French, but...</h4>

<p>First, my laptop default language is French, and I didn't really realize that it would have an impact on my first tests...and as you might imagine I had some weird results trying to speak English to an input which was waiting for some French.</p>

<p>So I figured out that I probably have to specify a language for my html document (seems legit, though), but eventually you might want to decorrelate the language of your documents to the language used specifically for your speech input and adding a lang attribute directly to your input works just fine.</p>
<p>Now I can speak German, it'll be fine as long as I've added `lang="de"` to my input.</p>

<h4>What was that you said ?</h4>

<p>Then I tried to simply console.log the onwebkitspeechchange event, to see what happens there and no one mentioned it but you don't just get one unique result which is bound to the value of the input element, but 5. Which allows you to display suggestions to the users.</p>
